# Parallellized CryptoKitties

## 1. Introduction

Parallel-Kitties is the parallelized version of the original CryptoKitties core developed by Dapper Labs (https://www.dapperlabs.com) using the concurrency framework.
The original CryptoKitties could be downloaded from https://github.com/dapperlabs/cryptokitties-bounty. The main goal of ParallelKitties is to demonstrate how a typical, 
real-world application written in Solidity with our concurrency control may achieve dramatic performance gains.

If you are only interested in trying Arcology testnet out without diving into specific technical details, [then please check this document out for an easier start.](./parallel-kitties-test-scripts.md)
