# Parallelized CryptoKitties

## 1. Introduction

Parallel-Kitties is the parallelized version of the original CryptoKitties core developed by Dapper Labs (https://www.dapperlabs.com) using the concurrency framework.
The original CryptoKitties could be downloaded from https://github.com/dapperlabs/cryptokitties-bounty. The main goal of ParallelKitties is to demonstrate how a typical, 
real-world application written in Solidity with our concurrency control may achieve dramatic performance gains.

## 2. Changes

The original implementation of `KittyBase.sol` would save kitty information in an array. The kitties' IDs are their index numbers in the array. When a new kitty is born, some info needs to be appended to the back of the array. The length of the array will be used for the next kitty's ID. We replaced this native array with a map since native Ethereum arrays don't support concurrent push back.

In the new implementation, kitty IDs are now the map keys and are generated by UUID generators. The map values are the kitty info. Since there is no way to get the length of a map, we added a new variable `totalBalance` to keep track of total kitties, which will be updated in a deferred call.
